       Note that what shows in Qt's renderer is not the same as what
       appears in a current Web browser.

       In particular <DIV> doesn't appear to work and we default to white-space: normal
       whereas code generated by Designer's editor defaults to white-space: pre. It also
       seems to interpret white-space: pre different than HTML 5 browsers.               -->

    <p id="regular">Look at the image on the right and follow these directions.</p>
        <p id="hint">Hints:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li id="hint">You can use the Zoom In button to look more closely.</li>
            <li id="hint">You can move the image around by &quot;dragging&quot; the image around. That is, by holding the mouse button down while you move it. </li>
            <li id="hint">You can reset the zooming and dragging by clicking the Reset button.</span></li>
        </ul>
    <p id="regular">Does the image look complete top to bottom? If so, press the "&quot;"Other Side&quot; button.</p>
    <p id="regular">Does the other siee also look complete top to bottom?

<p id="regular">If either side of the ballot did not look complete, press the Backup One button. The image from the prior ballot will appear on the right side.</p>

<p id="regular">Repeat checking the front and back of the prior ballot. Almost always the previous ballot will be fine, but if not press "Backup One" again.</p>

<p id="regular">Once you have found the images of the last good ballot on the screen, notice its imprint on the left side of the front.</p>

<p id="regular">It is possible that one or two of the ballots in the output bin of the scanner
have imprint numbers higher that the Last Good Number,
which is being displayed. If so: move those ballots back to input bin of the scanner, face down top edge leading.

<p id="regular">Once you have things arranged so that the number in the Next Ballot field is matched to the top ballot in the input tray, press Resume.</p>
